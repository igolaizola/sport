👋 Welcome to my sports-related repository!

Life is about more than just coding, and here I share my passion for sports.

I'm Iñigo Garcia Olaizola, and I enjoy participating in endurance sports. From my early days of canoeing at Santiagotarrak to my current love for triathlon, I work on improving my athletic skills. This repository showcases my personal achievements, training plans, and the possibility of additional sports-related content in the future.

Feel free to explore and join me on this exciting sporting journey!
